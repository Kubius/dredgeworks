---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.7.0

  Changes:
    - Split graphics off to a distinct package for better mod structure. No functionality changes in this version.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.6.4

  Changes:
    - Fixed an error (probably introduced in 2.0 update) where the floating belt recipe cost more belts than intended.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.6.3

  Changes:
    - Space Age: Gleba blue marsh / deep water now allows resource generation and permits refined concrete placement.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.6.2

  Changes:
    - Updated Cargo Ships compatibility component.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.6.1

  Changes:
    - Updated sprites to no longer use hr_version, in line with the new sprite standard.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.6.0

  Changes:
    - Seafloor drill now utilizes an earlier version of the electric mining drill from 0.18 (adapted from semi-classic-mining-drill) for distinct visuals.
    - Seafloor drill now costs steel and iron sticks instead of flotation platforms (more befitting its new appearance as an elevated rig).
    - In accordance with the new steel cost, seafloor drill research now requires steel processing as a prerequisite.
    - Seafloor drill now has four module slots.
    - New art for seafloor drill technology (still somewhat placeholder, but less obnoxiously so).
    - Added description text to the alternate flotation platform recipe that utilizes wood.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.5.3

  Changes:
    - Added a supplementary ore submersion procedure for Resource Spawner Overhaul.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.5.2

  Changes:
    - Further improved valid placement target detection for refined concrete; it's now inhibited by a tile having object layer collision.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.5.1

  Changes:
    - Fixed an oversight where out-of-map tiles were detected as valid placement targets for refined concrete.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.5.0

  Changes:
    - Added a special collision layer procedure for Cargo Ships compatibility, allowing correct generation of its offshore oil.
    - Water Ores is now incompatible as a consequence of the above (Dredgeworks now always handles this internally).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.4.3

  Changes:
    - Reworked refined concrete placement logic more extensively to behave well with Space Age (and other expansions to available tiles).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.4.2

  Changes:
    - Fixed non-concrete tile placement, again. Hopefully sticks this time.
    - No longer modify refined concrete yield by default as it's now a component of elevated rails. Yield can still be reduced for challenge, if desired.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.4.1

  Changes:
    - Fixes a problem with non-concrete tile placement due to collision changes in 2.0.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.4.0

  Changes:
    - Updated code for 2.0 compatibility. Has been tested briefly in core game; should not break with Space Age, but may interact oddly with it.
    - Water Ores is now an optional dependency, with Dredgeworks removing the ore elimination layer itself if Water Ores isn't present (optionality remains for mod compatibility).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.1

  Changes:
    - Fixed a lack of next_upgrade adjustment on the light buoy, causing incompatibility with a few mods which alter this on lamps.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.0

  Changes:
    - Added the light buoy, crafted with a lamp and some pipes. It's a lamp, but floating.
    - Updated ore submersion to submerge ore when water collision mask is detected, not when ground mask isn't (fixes weird interaction with Space Exploration).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.6

  Changes:
    - Inserters with a width 1 ("empty") hand base picture will no longer be indexed for floating inserter generation; allows compatibility with Arrow Inserter

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.5

  Changes:
    - Inserters set not to draw their held item will no longer be indexed for floating inserter generation, notably allowing compatibility with miniloaders

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.4

  Changes:
    - Inserters without a "minable" value set will no longer be indexed for floating inserter generation (attempt to cover some edge cases; if an inserter isn't floatable and it should be, chime in)
    - Moved inserter flotation to a distinct file for better readability

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.3

  Changes:
    - Significantly altered floating inserter generation with special support for Bob's inserter overhaul; if issues persist, please continue to report
    - Reduced flotation platform crafting time to 0.8 seconds and 0.5 seconds for plastic and wood recipes respectively (the former remains faster per platform)
    - Reduced seafloor drill crafting time from 4 seconds to 1

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.2

  Changes:
    - Floating inserters now skip assigning a fast replaceable group if the original inserter lacks one. Mod compatibility fix (update unnecessary if you're not affected)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.1

  Changes:
    - Fixed an oversight where non-basic, non-fluid ores (such as Krastorio 2's imersite) would attempt generation of a deep variant, causing a crash.
    - Non-basic, non-fluid ores can now be allowed to generate in water with a config option (and will appear on the water surface) but are disabled by default.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.0

  Changes:
    - Overhauled ore submersion to use procedural techniques; non-vanilla ores should now be submergeable, though visual parity isn't guaranteed
    - Adjusted technology progression; Wire Buoys are now available in a similar manner to electric distribution 1, and Aquatic Logistics only needs logistic science
    - Flotation platforms are now a bit more expensive, requiring 1 iron stick and 1 iron plate per platform (instead of per recipe)
    - Added a wood-based flotation platform recipe for early game or greenhouse mods. Slower per platform, each platform consumes 2 wood instead of 0.5 plastic

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.1

  Changes:
    - Fixed interaction when both Alien Biomes and Cargo Ships are installed, by allowing ocean spawn of all fluid-yielding resources.
    - Updated art for the Aquatic Logistics technology
    - Reduced seafloor drill flotation platform cost from 12 to 4

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.0

  Changes:
    - Initial release
