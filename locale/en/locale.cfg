floated=__1__ (floating)
submerged=__1__ (submerged)
submerged-desc=Ore below the water level. Landfill or other surface coverings will permanently remove it.

[entity-name]
light-buoy=Light buoy
deep-iron-ore=Submerged iron ore
deep-copper-ore=Submerged copper ore
deep-uranium-ore=Submerged uranium ore
deep-stone=Submerged stone
deep-coal=Submerged coal
wire-buoy=Wire buoy
seafloor-drill=Seafloor drill
floating-belt=Floating belt

[entity-description]
wire-buoy=Water counterpart to an electric pole. Can't be placed on land.
seafloor-drill=Drill platform altered for oceanic use. Can mine submerged or beached ores in radius.
flotation-platform=Can be fastened to certain equipment to allow it to float.

[item-name]
flotation-platform=Flotation platform

[item-description]
refined-concrete=Can be used to build on water.
refined-hazard-concrete=Can be used to build on water.

[recipe-name]
flotation-platform-wood=Flotation platform from wood

[recipe-description]
flotation-platform-wood=Making these without plastic is less efficient.

[technology-name]
wire-buoy-technology=__ENTITY__wire-buoy__s
floating-logistics-technology=Aquatic logistics
floating-drill-technology=__ENTITY__seafloor-drill__s

[technology-description]
wire-buoy-technology=Floating structure for electricity distribution.
floating-logistics-technology=Augment logistics equipment with flotation hardware, allowing it to operate on the surface of water.
floating-drill-technology=Extract resources from beneath the surface of water.

[mod-setting-name]
refcrete_default_fill=Refined concrete is default "landfill"
concrete_placement_cost=Refined concrete placement cost
shallow_oil_concrete=Fulgoran shallows allow refined concrete
allow_floating_edgecase=Allow unusual deposits on water
limit_belt_flotation=Limit floating belt generation
limit_inserter_flotation=Limit floating inserter generation

[mod-setting-description]
refcrete_default_fill=With this setting active, refined concrete will be used instead of landfill when placing blueprints without underlayment onto non-solid surfaces.
concrete_placement_cost=How many pieces of refined concrete must be used to place it as a tile. Raised by default to make sea-based building more expensive. Set to 0 to prevent mod from affecting the yield at all.
shallow_oil_concrete=Whether the shallower part of Fulgora's ocean permits placement of refined concrete. May be ignored if you are playing without Space Age.
allow_floating_edgecase=Resources which generate as neither a fluid nor a basic solid, such as Krastorio 2 imersite, will generate on the water surface if enabled.
limit_belt_flotation=Only generate floating versions of vanilla belts. Use if a mod's belts are incompatible with Dredgeworks flotation.
limit_inserter_flotation=Only generate floating versions of vanilla inserters. Use if a mod's inserters are incompatible with Dredgeworks flotation.
