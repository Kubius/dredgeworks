[mod-setting-name]
fish_safety=Restrict inserter fishing
nerf_concrete=Refined concrete yield

[mod-setting-description]
fish_safety=Only filter inserters can catch fish, to prevent accidental fishing.
nerf_concrete=Yield of the refined concrete recipe. Reduced by default to make sea-based building more expensive. Set to 0 to prevent mod from affecting the yield at all.
